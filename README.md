# 🩺 HealthClusters: Unveiling Hidden Patient Groups Through Unsupervised Learning

# Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to cluster patients based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle data. The goal is to discover hidden patterns for risk profiling, early intervention, and targeted care.

# Dataset
The dataset includes attributes such as:

Demographics: age, gender, residence type, smoking status

Clinical Metrics: blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, BMI

Medical History: heart disease, hypertension

Lifestyle: physical activity, smoking

# Preprocessing
Encoding: Categorical features (e.g., smoking status) encoded with LabelEncoder

Scaling: Used MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, and RobustScaler

Feature Engineering: PCA for dimensionality reduction, polynomial features for non-linearity, and KBest for selection

# Clustering Techniques
K-Means – Fast, good for spherical clusters

DBSCAN – Density-based, detects outliers

GMM – Probabilistic soft clustering

Agglomerative – Hierarchical, reveals multi-level structure

# Outcome
The resulting clusters offer insights into patient risk groups and support healthcare decision-making with interpretable patterns.
